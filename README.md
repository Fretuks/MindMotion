# Mind & Motion

*A lightweight gameplay systems mod adding Sanity, Insanity, and Tempo.*

## Epilepsy Warning

**Mind & Motion includes occasional screen flashes, distortion, and shader-based visual effects that may be triggered when Sanity becomes low or Insanity becomes high. Players with photosensitive epilepsy or sensitivity to flashing lights should disable visual effects in the mod’s configuration or avoid using the mod.**

## Overview

Mind & Motion is a small gameplay-enhancement mod inspired by *Deepwoken*. It introduces three new player attributes: **Sanity**, **Insanity**, and **Tempo**, that respond dynamically to your environment, combat state, and actions. These systems aim to add atmosphere and decision-making without changing core Minecraft progression.

All features are fully configurable and can be adjusted or disabled depending on your preferred playstyle.
